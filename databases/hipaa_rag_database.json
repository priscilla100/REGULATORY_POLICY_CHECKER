Provide a detailed explanation, no more than 10 pages in length, of how the proposed modification would be a significant improvement to the current standard in terms of the following principles:\n\n(i) Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by leading to cost reductions for, or improvements in benefits from, electronic health care transactions.\n\n(ii) Meet the needs of the health data standards user community, particularly health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.\n\n(iii) Be uniform and consistent with the other standards adopted under this part and, as appropriate, with other private and public sector health data standards.\n\n(iv) Have low additional development and implementation costs relative to the benefits of using the standard.\n\n(v) Be supported by an ANSI-accredited SSO or other private or public organization that would maintain the standard over time.\n\n(vi) Have timely development, testing, implementation, and updating procedures to achieve administrative simplification benefits faster.\n\n(vii) Be technologically independent of the computer platforms and transmission protocols used in electronic health transactions, unless they are explicitly part of the standard.\n\n(viii) Be precise, unambiguous, and as simple as possible.\n\n(ix) Result in minimum data collection and paperwork burdens on users.\n\n(x) Incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in the health care infrastructure (such as new services, organizations, and provider types) and information technology.\n\n(2)  Specifications for the proposed modification.

Provide written concurrences from trading partners who would agree to participate in the test.\n\n(b)  Basis for granting an exception.  The Secretary may grant an initial exception, for a period not to exceed 3 years, based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:\n\n(1) An assessment of whether the proposed modification demonstrates a significant improvement to the current standard.\n\n(2) The extent and length of time of the exception.\n\n(3) Consultations with DSMOs.\n\n(c)  Secretary's decision on exception.

If the Secretary does not grant an exception, the notification explains the reasons the Secretary considers the proposed modification would not be a significant improvement to the current standard and any other rationale for the denial.\n\n(d)  Organization's report on test results.  Within 90 days after the test is completed, an organization that receives an exception must submit a report on the results of the test, including a cost-benefit analysis, to a location specified by the Secretary by notice in the  Federal Register.\n\n(e)  Extension allowed.

An individual may revoke an authorization provided under this section at any time, provided that the revocation is in writing, except to the extent that:\n\n(i) The covered entity has taken action in reliance thereon; or\n\n(ii) If the authorization was obtained as a condition of obtaining insurance coverage, other law provides the insurer with the right to contest a claim under the policy or the policy itself.\n\n(6)  Documentation.

The statement \u201cend of the research study,\u201d \u201cnone,\u201d or similar language is sufficient if the authorization is for a use or disclosure of protected health information for research, including for the creation and maintenance of a research database or research repository.\n\n(vi) Signature of the individual and date.
